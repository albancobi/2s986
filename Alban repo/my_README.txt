# These are notes for myself, a README
# Cloning class materials to my local repository
I can always clone the class materials from the class github repo on the web
using this command and URL:

git clone https://github.com/PV-Lab/2s986_class.git

# Add remote repository
I added the class repository and called it 'githubmaterials' using the command:

git remote add githubmaterials https://github.com/PV-Lab/2s986_class.git

# Next (TO DO)
 I need to run git init to start version control and clone or pull materials
from the class repo in such a way that I don't overwrite my own materials in
my local folder
